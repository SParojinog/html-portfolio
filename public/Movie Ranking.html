<h1>The Best Movies According to Sean</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>I know it might seem like I just picked this because you used a Studio Ghibli film as an example. But it really is one my favorites of all time, alongside "Spirited Away" and "Princess Mononoke". How can you not love the character Sophie; a brave, broadminded and downright bad ass girl who talked down a powerful sorceress just to defend the love of her life.</p>
<h3>The Great Gatsby</h3>
<p>One of the most iconic film, whose characters were both masterfully brought to life by both Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. To this day, I have not yet read the book itself, considering I'm one of those "They always ruin the novel/book once they turn it to a movie" type of guy. It's simple, the movie was amazing and I'm wholly satisfied with it.</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>A mainstream and a well accepted masterpiece by almost all who've seen it. This was one of the movies that brought tears to my eyes and gave me courage to face life, using Forrest as an example. It's unlike no other to me.</p>
